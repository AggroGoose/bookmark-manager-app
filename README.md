# Bookmark Manager App

This project is an Advanced level challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I picked it because of its use of sorting and filtering for the dynamic cards. As I'm looking to build an ecommerce style project website, this challenge is perfect to play around with and get right.

The challenge has the option to make this a fullstack app and persist data, but as I already have experience connecting to databases and building out that infrastructure, I wanted to keep this light and use only React/Vite rather than a fullstack framework like NextJs. For styling I will use TailwindCSS. I may use Redux for state management, but I'm going to try to not use a state manager framework and try to build this in react itself. Ultimately this is to challenge myself more than anything.

Without further ado, let the challenge begin!
